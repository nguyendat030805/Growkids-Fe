Branch naming

Use the following naming conventions:

- feat/feature-name – New features

- fix/bug-description – Bug fixes

- docs/update-description – Documentation updates

- refactor/component-name – Code refactoring

- chore/update-config – Tooling or configuration changes

Examples:

- feat/login-screen

- fix/auth-error

- docs/update-readme

Commit messages

This project uses Conventional Commits, enforced by Husky + Commitlint.

Commit message format
<type>(<scope>): <description>

Allowed types

- feat – A new feature

- fix – A bug fix

- docs – Documentation only changes

- style – Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.

- refactor – Code changes without fixing bugs or adding features

- perf – Performance improvements

- test – Adding or fixing tests

- chore – Build process or tooling changes
Examples

```bash
feat(auth): add user authentication
fix(login): resolve validation issue
docs(api): update endpoint documentation
style(core): format code with prettier
refactor(database): optimize queries
test(auth): add unit tests for service
chore(deps): update dependencies
```

Code standards & tooling

This project enforces code quality using the following tools:

- ESLint: Code is automatically linted before each commit

- Prettier: Code formatting is enforced

- TypeScript: Strict typing is required

- Husky: Git hooks run checks before commit and push

- Commitlint: Commit messages must follow Conventional Commits

Before pushing code, make sure all checks pass.
Testing

# Run unit tests

npm run test

# Run e2e tests

npm run test:e2e

# Run tests with coverage

npm run test:cov

Pull Request Process

1. Create feature branch from dev
2. Make your changes
3. Ensure all tests pass
4. Commit with conventional commit format
5. Push to your branch
6. Create Pull Request
